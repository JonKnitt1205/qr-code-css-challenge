## My process
### What I learned

I have used everything in this project before so this project was used to keep myself fresh on basic HTML/CSS because I want to improve on these skills before an upcoming hackathon. The main focus was centering the cardand getting everything to look accurate to the challenge. I also had to use an outside google font which I had never done before.

### Continued development

In order to complete this I was definitely using very hacky teqniques, guessing and checking, not really using any knowledge or skill, just hoping what I wrote was correct. I just want to keep practicing to feel more confident when writing css.
